# CHANGELOG
#
# 2011 December 10 - Peter O'Malley & Jim Wenner
#
# Fixed bug where doesn't add devices if no SOCKETS connected.
#
# 2011 December 5 - Jim Wenner
#
# Added ability to read TCPIP (Ethernet) devices if configured to use
# sockets (i.e., fixed port address). To do this, added getSocketsList
# function and changed refresh_devices.
#
# 2011 December 3 - Jim Wenner
#
# Added ability to read TCPIP (Ethernet) devices. Must be configured
# using VXI-11 or LXI so that address ends in INSTR. Does not accept if
# configured to use sockets. To do this, changed refresh_devices.
#
# To be clear, the gpib system already supported ethernet devices just fine
# as long as they weren't using raw socket protocol. The changes that
# were made here and in the next few revisions are hacks to make socket
# connections work, and should be improved.
#
# 2021 October 17 - Clayton Ho
# Added back automatic device polling
#
# 2021 November 25 - Clayton Ho
# Added configurable device polling
#
# 2021 December 15 - Clayton Ho
# Subclassed it from PollingServer to support polling
# instead of using server methods
#
# 2022 November 6 - Clayton Ho
# Copied over some changes made by Landon in UCLALabrad repository:
#   - _refreshDevices now closes devices before deleting them from the holding dictionary
#   - timeout function now actually sets the timeout with the GPIB device instead of just storing it within the context
#
# 2022 November 20 - Clayton Ho
# Removed stupid use of read_raw/write in read() and query().
# Removed TCPIP as a recognized device type since all bus servers will recognize the network device, leading to duplicates.
# Implemented stopServer, which closes any and all open devices (yes, this isn't tremendously necessary, but whatever).
#
# 2022 December 28 - Clayton Ho (updated to 1.5.4)
# Fixed error handling in _refreshDevices; bus server now works nearly perfectly.
